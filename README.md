# Mini-Project
#This project involves building an image classification system using the `skimage` library for image processing and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Images were preprocessed and relevant features were extracted. The SVM model was trained and evaluated, achieving high accuracy in categorizing images into predefined classes. This approach effectively demonstrates the use of SVM and `skimage` in image classification tasks.
